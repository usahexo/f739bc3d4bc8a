Cmd368, 1899 Hoffenheim, and Dickinson all had unique beginnings that led them to where they are today.

Cmd368 was created in 1998 by two friends, Jörg Müller and Stefan Kühn, who decided to start their own business. They started out by developing software for mobile devices.

1899 Hoffenheim was founded in 1899 by railway worker Adolf Orso as a gymnastics club. The club's early years were uneventful, but in 1929 they merged with another club and took on their new name, 1899 Hoffenheim. The club continued to compete in local leagues until they were promoted to the regional level in 1965. In 1978, they finally reached the first division of the German football league system. However, they were relegated after just one season and has since been bouncing between the second and third divisions.

Dickinson was founded in 1873 by three businessmen from Philadelphia: John Wanamaker, Robert H. Smith, and Edward W. Clark. At first, the company sold general merchandise such as clothing, furniture, and farm equipment. However, they soon shifted their focus to retailing magazines and books. By 1880, Dickinson had become one of the largest magazine retailers in the country. They even published their own magazines for a time. Dickinson remained a successful company until it filed for bankruptcy in 1991
