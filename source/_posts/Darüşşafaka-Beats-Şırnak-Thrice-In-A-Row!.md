#  Darüşşafaka Keeps Rolling, Beating Gaziantep In Playoffs

The Darüşşafaka basketball team has proven their dominance in the Turkish Basketball League Playoffs, beating Gaziantep convincingly in all four games of their semifinal matchup.

Darüşşafaka’s incredible season continues as they outclassed Gaziantep, who was considered the underdog of the semifinal matchup. While Gaziantep managed to take one game off of Darüşşafaka, they were never really in contention against the eventual champions.

Led by coach Ergin Ataman and stars like Scottie Wilbekin and Cedi Osman, Darüşşafaka looks poised to take home their first championship since 2013. This would be a significant achievement for a team that has had to rebuild after several high-profile departures in recent years.

With an exciting core of young talent and experienced veterans, Darüşşafaka looks set to make some noise in Europe next season as well. Fans will have their chance to see the team in action this weekend, when they take on Anadolu Efes in the Turkish Basketball League Finals.

#  When Do You Split On Blackjack Darüşşafaka?

One of the questions that players often ask dealers at blackjack tables is when they should split their cards. Many people believe that they should always split Aces and 8s, but is this really the case? In this article, we will take a look at when you should split on blackjack Darüşşafaka and when you should hold your cards.

If you have two identical cards, such as 2 Aces or 2 Kings, then you should always split them. This is because you have a high chance of achieving a blackjack if you are dealt another Ace or King. However, if you have two different cards, such as a 3 and a 5, then you should only split them if the dealer has a low card showing.

If the dealer has a 4 or less showing, then you should split your 3 and 5 cards. This is because the dealer has a high chance of busting if they are forced to hit on those numbers. However, if the dealer has a 5 or 6 showing, then you should not split your cards – instead, you should keep them together and hope for the best.

When it comes to 8s, there is no definite answer on whether or not you should split them. This is because 8s can be either good or bad depending on the other cards that are showing. If there are lots of low cards remaining in the deck, then it might be worth splitting your 8s. However, if there are lots of high cards remaining in the deck, then it might be better to keep your 8s together.
