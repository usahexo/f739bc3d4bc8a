#  Atlantic City's Best Burger Joint Closes Doors After Failing To Survive Gambling Industry Turmoil 

Atlantic City's most popular burger joint has closed its doors after failing to survive the gambling industry turmoil. The restaurant, which was known for its delicious burgers and extensive beer list, served locals and tourists alike for over 10 years.

Industry analysts say that the closure is due to the fact that Atlantic City's casino industry is in a state of flux. With increasing competition from other states and a decline in tourism, casinos are struggling to bring in the same profits they used to. This has had a trickle-down effect on local businesses, including restaurants.

The closure of the burger joint is just another sign of the times in Atlantic City. Casino closures and job losses have become commonplace in recent years, and it seems unlikely that things will improve anytime soon.

Atlantic City's Microgaming is shutting down, laying off its entire staff.

The closure comes as a surprise to many in the industry, as the company had recently begun aggressively expanding its operations.

In a statement released to employees, management cited "lack of liquidity" as the reason for the closure. The company is said to owe millions of dollars to creditors, including several prominent Atlantic City casinos.

The closure of Microgaming will leave nearly 100 people without jobs, and is another blow to the city's already struggling economy.

Microgaming, an iconic Atlantic City burger joint, is shutting down after the landlord refused to renegotiate their lease.

Opened in 1990 by the late, great John Sauce, Microgaming has been a staple of the Atlantic City food scene for over 25 years. The restaurant is known for their delicious burgers and unique atmosphere.

Unfortunately, times have changed and Microgaming was unable to renegotiate their lease with the landlord. They will be closing their doors for the final time on May 1st.

Many people are saddened by the news, including local residents and tourists alike. Microgaming was a favorite spot for generations of people and will be sorely missed.

#  GameBurger in Atlantic City is closing its doors due to the gambling industry slowdown 

Atlantic City, NJ - GameBurger, a restaurant located in the heart of Atlantic City's casino district, is closing its doors after 12 years in business. The closure is attributed to the slowdown in the gambling industry, which has drastically reduced foot traffic in the city's casinos.

"It's just been really tough here lately," said GameBurger owner Rich Kline. "The casino business has been in decline for a while now, and that's had a big impact on our business."

Kline said he had been considering closing the restaurant for some time, but decided to go ahead and do it now because of the current economic climate. "With interest rates so low, it just doesn't make sense to keep the place open," he said.

GameBurger isn't the only business to suffer from the gambling industry slowdown. Several other eateries and retail stores have also closed their doors in recent months.

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said he is disappointed by the news but not completely surprised. "The casinos are our lifeblood, and when they're not doing well, it impacts all of us," he said.

Guardian said he remains hopeful that Atlantic City will rebound and that the gaming industry will start to pick up again soon. "But until then, we'll just have to deal with these closures," he said.

#  Microgaming in Atlantic City shutting down, leaves employees out of a job

Microgaming, one of the leading software providers for online casinos, is shutting down its Atlantic City operation, leaving around 100 employees out of a job.

The closure comes after the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement determined that Microgaming was not in compliance with state regulations.

This is just the latest in a series of casino closures in Atlantic City, which has been struggling for years to regain its former glory as a gambling mecca.

In 2014, four of the city's twelve casinos closed their doors. And just last month, another two casinos announced they would be shuttering their operations.

Atlantic City is facing increasing competition from other gambling destinations such as Las Vegas and Macau. And there has been a shift in consumer preferences towards online gambling over brick-and-mortar casinos.

With so much competition and demand for gambling services waning, it's no surprise that Microgaming is pulling out of Atlantic City.
