#  Dragon Hunter Game update finally released – casino heist possible again!

For the last two weeks, there’s been a ton of speculation in the Dragon Hunter community about whether or not Glu would release another update. The game has been in a bit of a lull since the casino heist update in January and many were starting to lose hope that anything new would ever come.

But, as promised by Glu, a new update finally arrived yesterday! While it doesn’t include any new dragons (bummer), it does add some new features that players have been eagerly waiting for.

Chief among these is the long-awaited return of casino heists! This was my favorite update from the original game, so I’m excited to see it brought back. Now we can all rob those pesky casinos and take their gold once again!

There are also some other improvements and bug fixes in this latest update. For example, you can now sell duplicates of items from your inventory, which is great news for those of us who like to horde everything we find. And there have been tweaks to the battle system to make it more fair and balanced.

Overall, this latest update is a big step in the right direction for Dragon Hunter. It reinvigorates the game with some much-needed new content while fixing some of the issues that have been plaguing it lately. So if you’ve been feeling a little bit bored with DH lately, now is definitely the time to jump back in!

#  Casino heist possible just days after Dragon Hunter Game update!

A casino in the city of Las Vegas was held up just days after a major game update for the popular mobile game, Dragon Hunter. In the game, players travel through a world filled with dragons and other creatures in order to collect coins and gems.

According to police reports, three armed men entered the casino at around 2am and demanded money from the staff. They were able to get away with an unknown amount of cash. This is just the latest in a string of robberies that have taken place in Las Vegas over the past few months.

Many people are speculating that the recent game update for Dragon Hunter may be connected to the robberies. The update includes new features such as an increased level cap and new armour and weapons. Some people believe that the criminals may be using the game to learn about the layout of the casinos and plan their robberies accordingly.

The developers of Dragon Hunter have issued a statement denying any connection between the game and the robberies. They urge players not to act out of character in order to try and mimic what they see in the game.

#  Two weeks until casino heist possible again in Dragon Hunter Game! 

Two weeks ago, we reported that casino heists were no longer possible in Dragon Hunter Game. This was because the developer removed the ability to teleport inside of casinos. 

Many players were disappointed by this change, as casino heists were a popular way to make money in the game. 

Fortunately, the developer has announced that teleporting inside of casinos will be re-enabled on January 26th. This means that casino heists will be possible again starting next week! 

So if you’re looking to make some quick money, be sure to start planning your casino heist strategy. The best time to hit a casino is usually late at night, when there are fewer players around. 

Good luck and have fun!

#  Just two months until you can do the casino heist again in Dragon Hunter Game – are you prepared?

The release of the much anticipated Dragon Hunter Game is drawing ever nearer, and with it comes all the thrills and excitement of pulling off the perfect casino heist. If you’re like us, you’ve been counting down the days and planning your strategy – but no matter how well you think you know the game, there are always new surprises in store.

The first thing to note is that this time around there are several different ways to complete the heist. You can go in as quietly as possible, sneaking past security and making off with the loot undetected; or you can launch a full-scale assault, using all the tools at your disposal to take on the guards and make a clean getaway. Whichever route you choose, teamwork and careful planning are key to success.

Second, don’t underestimate the security measures in place. The casino is well guarded, so you’ll need to use all your cunning and agility to bypass the patrols and get to the vault. Make sure you have a good supply of tools – including lock picks, explosives and disguises – if you want to stand a chance of succeeding.

Finally, remember that luck plays a big role in Dragon Hunter Game. Even if you do everything right, things can still go wrong at the last minute; so don’t get too discouraged if things don’t go according to plan. Keep your head down and keep on trying until you finally succeed.

We can’t wait for Dragon Hunter Game to be released – are you ready for some serious heists?
