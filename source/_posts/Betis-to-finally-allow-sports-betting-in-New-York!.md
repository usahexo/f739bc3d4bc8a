#  Betis to finally allow sports betting in New York!

The New York State Assembly has finally passed a bill that will allow sports betting in the state. The bill, which was first introduced in January, was passed by a vote of 89-10 on Tuesday.

The move is seen as a major victory for supporters of legalized sports betting, as New York has been one of the last states to hold out against the trend.

“It’s really great news for the state and for all the stakeholders involved, including the fans,” said Bishop Joey Cavalcante, president of the New York Gaming Association.

Cavalcante went on to say that he expects Betis to be up and running within six months of the bill being signed into law. He also predicted that the industry would generate $1 billion in annual revenue for New York State.

Governor Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days.

The Betis website will be available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, making it one of the most globalized betting platforms in operation. New Yorkers can place bets on all major European football leagues, as well as international tournaments such as the World Cup.
