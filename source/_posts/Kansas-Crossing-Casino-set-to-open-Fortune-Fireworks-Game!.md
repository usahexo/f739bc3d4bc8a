#  New game addition lights up Kansas Crossing Casino!

Kansas Crossing Casino has announced the addition of a new game to its floor – lights out!

This exciting new game is based on the popular TV game show of the same name. Lights out is a blackjack variant that pits players against the casino in an attempt to eliminate all of the cards from the deck.

The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards, and each player is dealt two cards face up and one card face down. The face down card is turned over to reveal its suit and denomination. The goal of the game is to eliminate all of the cards from the deck through playing blackjack hands.

Cards are eliminated by playing them as part of a blackjack hand. A player may either hit or stand with their two cards, and must hit if they have a total of less than 12. When all of the cards have been eliminated from the deck, the player with the highest score at that point is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the highest face value card wins.

Kansas Crossing Casino has been stocked with lights out tables for players to enjoy, so be sure to come check it out soon!
