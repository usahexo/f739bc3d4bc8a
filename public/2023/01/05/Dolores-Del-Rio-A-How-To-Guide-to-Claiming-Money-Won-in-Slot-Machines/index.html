One of the best known and loved Slot machines is Dolores Del Rio. Named after the Mexican actress, this Slot machine offers players the chance to win some serious cash prizes.</p>
<p>Dolores Del Rio is a five-reel Slot machine with 30 paylines. The game is set in a Spanish town and its symbols reflect this, including guitars, maracas and flowers. The Wild symbol in the game is represented by a golden bell and this can substitute for any other symbol to help create winning combinations. There is also a Free Spins bonus round which can be triggered by landing three or more of the scatter symbols anywhere on the reels.</p>
<p>To start playing, you need to first decide how many paylines you want to bet on. You can do this by using the minus and plus buttons at the bottom left of the screen. Once you’ve decided on your bet, all you need to do is hit ‘spin’. If you want to play automatically, hit ‘ autoplay’ and choose your number of spins.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when playing Dolores Del Rio is that the Wild symbol only appears on reels 2, 3 and 4 so keep an eye out for it! The Free Spins bonus round can also be very lucrative so try and land as many scatter symbols as possible during your spins.</p>
