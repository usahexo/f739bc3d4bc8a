Located in Oxon Hill, Maryland, this casino welcomes guests of all ages, but caps the minimum gambling age at 18. So if you’re wondering how old you have to be to gamble at National Harbor Casino, the answer is 18.</p>
<p>The National Harbor Casino features an impressive selection of slot machines and table games, so whether you’re a seasoned gambler or a first-time player, you’ll find something to enjoy. And if you need some help getting started, the casino’s gaming staff are happy to provide tips and advice.</p>

<h1 id="18-Years-Old-is-the-Minimum-Age-to-Gamble-at-National-Harbor-Casino"><a href="#18-Years-Old-is-the-Minimum-Age-to-Gamble-at-National-Harbor-Casino" class="headerlink" title="18 Years Old is the Minimum Age to Gamble at National Harbor Casino"></a>18 Years Old is the Minimum Age to Gamble at National Harbor Casino</h1><p>National Harbor Casino is one of the most popular casinos in Maryland. The casino offers a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, and poker. In order to gamble at National Harbor Casino, you must be at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>This age requirement is stricter than many other casinos in Maryland. For example, the minimum age to gamble at Rocky Gap Casino Resort is 21 years old. However, the minimum age to gamble at Hollywood Casino Perryville is only 18 years old.</p>
<p>The reason for the 18-year-old minimum age requirement at National Harbor Casino is due to Maryland law. In Maryland, the minimum age to gamble is 18 years old unless you are playing bingo or playing the lottery, in which case the minimum age is 16 years old.</p>
<p>National Harbor Casino has been open since June 2017. The casino is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International.</p>
<h1 id="National-Harbor-Casino-Has-18-Minimum-Age-Requirement"><a href="#National-Harbor-Casino-Has-18-Minimum-Age-Requirement" class="headerlink" title="National Harbor Casino Has 18 Minimum Age Requirement"></a>National Harbor Casino Has 18 Minimum Age Requirement</h1><p>The National Harbor Casino has an 18 minimum age requirement in place. This is because the casino intends to offer gaming services, which are not allowed to be provided to those who are under 18 years of age per Maryland law.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there are other casinos in the state of Maryland that do not have an 18 minimum age requirement. However, these casinos do not offer gaming services, but rather only offer various types of entertainment options.</p>
<p>The National Harbor Casino is located in Prince George’s County, which is a short distance away from Washington D.C. The casino is the largest development ever undertaken in Prince George’s County and it is expected to create thousands of jobs once it opens.</p>
<p>In addition to the 18 minimum age requirement, the National Harbor Casino will also require all guests to show a valid form of identification before they are allowed entry into the casino. This means that those who are 18 years of age or older will be able to enjoy all that the casino has to offer, while those who are younger than 18 will not be able to enter.</p>
<h1 id="National-Harbor-Casino-Sets-Age-Limit-at-18"><a href="#National-Harbor-Casino-Sets-Age-Limit-at-18" class="headerlink" title="National Harbor Casino Sets Age Limit at 18"></a>National Harbor Casino Sets Age Limit at 18</h1><p>The would-be casino and resort complex at National Harbor just became a little more family friendly. On Wednesday, the MGM announced that the new casino will have an age limit of 18 years old, barring anyone from entering the gaming floor who is not of legal age.</p>
<p>MGM officials told local reporters that the decision on setting the age limit was based on market research that indicates that most people who visit casinos are over the age of 21. In order to provide a “comfortable and safe experience” for all guests, the company has decided to restrict access to those who are of legal gambling age.</p>
<p>Some parents were pleased with the news, saying that they feel more comfortable bringing their children to a casino that has an age limit in place. Others lamented what they see as another example of adults-onlyfocused establishments.</p>
<p>National Harbor is expected to open in late 2017. It will feature a luxury hotel, high-end retail outlets, and a 300,000-square-foot casino with over 4,000 slot machines and approximately 150 table games.</p>

The legal gambling age in Maryland is 21 years old, but there are a few exceptions.</p>
<p>National Harbor Casino is located just outside of Washington D.C. and offers a variety of gaming options, including table games, slots, and poker. The casino is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and offers a range of dining and entertainment options as well.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a place to gamble in Maryland, National Harbor Casino is the place to go. Just be sure you are 18 years old or older!</p>
