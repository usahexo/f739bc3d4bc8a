The good news is that even if you don’t have any experience playing casino blackjack, you can easily learn the ropes in a hurry. In this article, we’re going to teach you the basics of how to play non gaming blackjack like a pro.</p>
<p>To begin with, let’s take a look at the basic rules of blackjack. In blackjack, the objective is to draw cards until your hand total equals 21 or as close to 21 as possible. If your hand total exceeds 21, you “bust” and automatically lose the hand. The player who has the hand total closest to 21 without going over wins the pot.</p>
<p>In addition to conventional card values (Aces count as 1 or 11, 2-10 are face value), there are also special blackjack cards. A blackjack is a combination of an Ace and a 10-value card (Jack, Queen or King), which pays out 3:2 on your bet amount. If you are dealt any other combination of an Ace and 10-value card, it is counted as a regular 21 (not a blackjack) and pays out 1:1 on your bet amount.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve gone over the basics of how to play non gaming blackjack, let’s take a look at some tips that can help you improve your odds of winning. First and foremost, it’s important to remember that casino blackjack is a game of probability. This means that over the long run, the house edge will eventually catch up with you and you will lose money. However, by following a few simple tips, you can minimize the house edge and increase your chances of winning in the process.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to keep in mind when playing casino blackjack is to always stick to basic strategy. Basic strategy is a set of guidelines that tells you how to play every possible hand based on the two cards you are initially dealt. By following basic strategy, you can reduce the house edge down to around 0.5%, which is far better than if you were playing without using any strategy at all.</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when playing casino blackjack is to never split 8s or Aces. Splitting 8s gives the dealer an advantage since he now has two chances to get a natural 21 (a hand totaling 21 consisting only of first two cards). Furthermore, splitting Aces allows the dealer to hit on soft 17 (a hand containing an Ace that can be counted as either 1 or 11), which gives him an even bigger advantage over players. Whenever possible, always try to stand on hands totaling 17 or more.</p>
<p>Finally, another key thing to keep in mind when playing casino blackjack is not to bet too much money at once. Start off by betting small amounts and work your way up as you become more comfortable with the game. This will help ensure that you don’t lose too much money if things don’t go your way early on in the game.</p>

Secondly, always remember that the house edge is in favor of the casino, so don’t get too caught up in trying to win every hand.

        <h1 id="How-to-have-a-good-poker-face-–-Southampton-FC-edition"><a href="#How-to-have-a-good-poker-face-–-Southampton-FC-edition" class="headerlink" title="How to have a good poker face – Southampton FC edition"></a>How to have a good poker face – Southampton FC edition</h1><p>One of the key things to remember in poker is that you need to have a good poker face. This means always showing the same level of emotion, no matter what cards you have. Southampton FC have had their ups and downs in recent years, but they’ve always seemed to have had a strong poker face.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this was in the 2006-2007 season. The Saints were battling relegation near the end of the season, but they managed to win their last three games and stay up. This was largely thanks to the performances of goalkeeper Kelvin Davis and striker Rickie Lambert.</p>
<p>Davis was particularly impressive – he made some incredible saves in those final games, including a penalty save against Wigan Athletic. Lambert also scored two vital goals in those last three games. Both players displayed great composure under pressure and never let their emotions get the better of them.</p>
<p>Southampton FC have continued this tradition in subsequent seasons, with players like Adam Lallana and Morgan Schneiderlin showing tremendous mental strength. Even when they’ve been on the receiving end of some heavy defeats, they’ve never shown signs of weakness or panic.</p>
<p>The current Southampton side will be looking to continue this streak during the upcoming Premier League season. New manager Ronald Koeman has brought in some new players, but it’s unclear how they will cope under pressure. The likes of Pablo Osvaldo and Dejan Lovren could be crucial in determining how well Southampton do this season – both players have a history of struggling under pressure.</p>
<p>So far, Koeman seems confident that his team can handle the pressure. After losing their first game against Liverpool, he said “I don’t think there is anything wrong about playing under pressure because we are used to that at Southampton […] We know what we have to do and we will go for it.” </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Southampton perform this season – they certainly have the ability to cause an upset or two. But will they be able to keep up their good poker faces when things start to go wrong? Only time will tell…</p>
<h1 id="The-art-of-keeping-your-composure-–-Southampton-FC-style"><a href="#The-art-of-keeping-your-composure-–-Southampton-FC-style" class="headerlink" title="The art of keeping your composure – Southampton FC style"></a>The art of keeping your composure – Southampton FC style</h1><p>Southampton FC are one of the most consistent teams in the English Premier League, having finished no lower than 8th in the past 6 seasons. How do they achieve this level of consistency?</p>
<p>A large part of Southampton’s success can be attributed to their ability to stay composed under pressure. They never get too carried away when they’re winning, nor do they let themselves get too down when they’re losing. This mental toughness is crucial in such a competitive league, and it’s something that the team has developed over time.</p>
<p>One of the key players in Southampton’s squad is captain James Ward-Prowse. He’s been with the club since he was a youngster, and he knows what it takes to succeed at this level. In an interview with the BBC, Ward-Prowse spoke about the importance of staying calm under pressure:</p>
<p>“It’s definitely something we pride ourselves on as a squad - our composure and remaining calm under pressure. That comes with experience and maturity and I think we’ve got a lot of that in the team.”</p>
<p>Southampton have also been helped by the arrival of new manager Ralph Hasenhüttl. The Austrian is known for his high-intensity style of football, and he’s already had a positive impact on the team. They now seem more confident and determined than ever before, which is evident from their recent results.</p>
<p>The art of keeping your composure is something that can be learned by anyone. Southampton FC are a perfect example of how it can be done successfully in a high-pressure environment.</p>

Southampton FC’s players have been guilty of this in the past few seasons, making it hard for the supporters to get behind the team. The lack of entertainment on the pitch has forced some fans to jump ship and look for other teams to support.</p>
<p>Playing in a way that is difficult to understand and frustrating for the fans is not going to help improve your image. Fans want to see their team win, but they also want to be entertained in the process. If you are not providing that, they will show their disapproval through booing.</p>
<p>The best way to combat this is by playing attractive football and scoring goals. That will get the fans on your side and make sure they are not focusing on anything else but your success on the pitch.</p>

With a rich history dating back to 1885, the Saints have won several major trophies and boast some of the best players to ever grace the Premier League.</p>
<p>What sets Southampton FC apart from other clubs is their ability to stay in control under pressure – both on and off the pitch. This comes from years of experience and, more importantly, a lot of hard work and dedication from the players and staff.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll share some tips and tricks on how to stay in control – from Southampton FC’s very own poker faces!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Be disciplined<br>One of the key traits of any successful team is discipline. This applies both on and off the pitch, as Southampton FC have shown time and time again. Players must be focused and disciplined when playing, while staff must also be professional and organised when dealing with the media or managing different aspects of the club.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay calm under pressure<br>When things get tough, it’s important to stay calm under pressure and not let emotions get in the way. This is something that Southampton FC are experts at, as they’ve shown time and time again in big games. By staying calm under pressure, players are able to think clearly and make better decisions – which often leads to success on the pitch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay positive<br>It’s easy to lose focus or get down on yourself when things aren’t going your way. However, Southampton FC players have always been known for their positive attitude – even when times are tough. By staying positive, players are able to motivate themselves and keep pushing forward – no matter what the situation may be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be confident in your abilities<br>One of the most important things for any player is confidence; without it you’ll never reach your full potential. Southampton FC players have always been known for their confidence on the ball, as they know they can beat anyone when they’re playing well. By being confident in your abilities, you’ll be able to take on anything that’s thrown your way – both on and off the pitch.</p>

This is as true in football as it is in poker – and Southampton FC have been one of the teams who have mastered this art better than most in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>When Claude Puel was in charge of the team, they were particularly noted for their ability to vary their tactics from game to game, keeping the opposition on their toes. Under Mauricio Pellegrino, that seems to have continued, with the Saints often looking like a different side from one match to the next.</p>
<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>There are several factors that go into making this possible. Firstly, Southampton have always had a large squad with good depth, meaning that they can rotate players more easily than some other teams. Secondly, they have been very good at recruiting players who are versatile and can play in more than one position – again giving Pellegrino more options when it comes to putting together his starting XI.</p>
<h1 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>But the biggest reason for Southampton’s success in this area is undoubtedly their players’ poker faces. Their ability to remain calm and unperturbed under pressure has been crucial in helping them keep opposing teams guessing. Even when they are down or behind in a game, they never seem to panic; they just continue playing their own game and wait for their chance to strike.</p>
