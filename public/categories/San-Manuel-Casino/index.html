The casino would be located on a portion of the east side of the city near the baseball stadium and convention center, but some local residents are opposed to the idea.</p>
<p>Supporters of the casino say that it would create jobs and bring in new revenue for the city, while opponents argue that it would cause traffic problems and increase crime. A spokesman for the developers said this week that they are still weighing their options and have not made a final decision on the location.</p>
<p>The announcement of the preferred site has sparked a heated debate among local residents, with both sides airing their concerns in letters to the editor and on social media. Some people are in favor of the casino because they think it will bring in much-needed jobs and revenue, while others are concerned about its potential effects on traffic, crime, and property values.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, it’s clear that this issue is going to continue to be a hot topic for many months to come. The developers have said that they hope to break ground on the casino by next summer, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to overcome the objections of local residents.</p>
