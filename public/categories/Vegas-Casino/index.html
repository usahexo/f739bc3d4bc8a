<p>The first game was played on October 13th in Şırnak, with the home team taking the early lead. However, Darüşşafaka soon managed to catch up and take the lead themselves, ending the first half with a score of 41-32. In the second half, they managed to keep their lead and win by a final score of 73-60.</p>
<p>The second game was played in Istanbul on October 20th. This time, Şırnak took an early lead, but Darüşşafaka fought back and ended the first half with a score of 43-37. In the second half, they continued to dominate and won by a final score of 91-76.</p>
<p>The third and final game was played in Istanbul again on October 27th. This time, Şırnak started off strong and took an early lead. However, Darüşşafaka didn’t give up and fought back, eventually taking the lead themselves. They went on to win by a final score of 89-78.</p>
<p>This impressive start to the season puts Darüşşafaka in a good position to make it into the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Darussafaka-Keeps-Rolling-Beating-Gaziantep-In-Playoffs"><a href="#Darussafaka-Keeps-Rolling-Beating-Gaziantep-In-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Darüşşafaka Keeps Rolling, Beating Gaziantep In Playoffs"></a>Darüşşafaka Keeps Rolling, Beating Gaziantep In Playoffs</h1><p>The Darüşşafaka basketball team has proven their dominance in the Turkish Basketball League Playoffs, beating Gaziantep convincingly in all four games of their semifinal matchup.</p>
<p>Darüşşafaka’s incredible season continues as they outclassed Gaziantep, who was considered the underdog of the semifinal matchup. While Gaziantep managed to take one game off of Darüşşafaka, they were never really in contention against the eventual champions.</p>
<p>Led by coach Ergin Ataman and stars like Scottie Wilbekin and Cedi Osman, Darüşşafaka looks poised to take home their first championship since 2013. This would be a significant achievement for a team that has had to rebuild after several high-profile departures in recent years.</p>
<p>With an exciting core of young talent and experienced veterans, Darüşşafaka looks set to make some noise in Europe next season as well. Fans will have their chance to see the team in action this weekend, when they take on Anadolu Efes in the Turkish Basketball League Finals.</p>
<h1 id="When-Do-You-Split-On-Blackjack-Darussafaka"><a href="#When-Do-You-Split-On-Blackjack-Darussafaka" class="headerlink" title="When Do You Split On Blackjack Darüşşafaka?"></a>When Do You Split On Blackjack Darüşşafaka?</h1><p>One of the questions that players often ask dealers at blackjack tables is when they should split their cards. Many people believe that they should always split Aces and 8s, but is this really the case? In this article, we will take a look at when you should split on blackjack Darüşşafaka and when you should hold your cards.</p>
<p>If you have two identical cards, such as 2 Aces or 2 Kings, then you should always split them. This is because you have a high chance of achieving a blackjack if you are dealt another Ace or King. However, if you have two different cards, such as a 3 and a 5, then you should only split them if the dealer has a low card showing.</p>
<p>If the dealer has a 4 or less showing, then you should split your 3 and 5 cards. This is because the dealer has a high chance of busting if they are forced to hit on those numbers. However, if the dealer has a 5 or 6 showing, then you should not split your cards – instead, you should keep them together and hope for the best.</p>
<p>When it comes to 8s, there is no definite answer on whether or not you should split them. This is because 8s can be either good or bad depending on the other cards that are showing. If there are lots of low cards remaining in the deck, then it might be worth splitting your 8s. However, if there are lots of high cards remaining in the deck, then it might be better to keep your 8s together.</p>

<p>Darüşşafaka defeated reigning champions Real Madrid 79-73, while Fenerbahçe beat Olympiakos 83-81.</p>
<p>This was Darüşşafaka’s first ever victory over Real Madrid, and it leaves them in fourth place in the EuroLeague standings.</p>
<p>Fenerbahçe meanwhile remain in first place, with their latest win putting them five games clear of second-placed CSKA Moscow.</p>
<h1 id="Darussafaka-Beats-Olympiakos-in-Greek-Derby"><a href="#Darussafaka-Beats-Olympiakos-in-Greek-Derby" class="headerlink" title="Darüşşafaka Beats Olympiakos in Greek Derby"></a>Darüşşafaka Beats Olympiakos in Greek Derby</h1><p>Darüşşafaka Doğuş, a Turkish basketball club, recorded an upset victory over Olympiakos, one of the most successful clubs in Greece, in the Greek derby matchup last week.</p>
<p>The match was closely contested throughout, but Darüşşafaka was able to pull away in the fourth quarter and win 73-64. This was a major upset given Olympiakos’s significantly greater experience and track record.</p>
<p>In addition to this victory, Darüşşafaka also boasts wins over top clubs such as CSKA Moscow and FC Barcelona. This has helped the team to establish itself as one of the top teams in Europe.</p>
<p>The Turkish club will now look to continue its strong play as the Euroleague season progresses.</p>
